DotNetInfo
==========

*Total Commander* content plugin to get some basic info about .NET assemblies like *PublicKeyToken*, *AssemblyVersion*, etc.

####About


A simple "demo" plugin written in C# (yes! it's possible).
It's been written just to prove myself it can be done after a while of researches. Perhaps it will be improved in time to get more object-oriented feeling. For now it's a straighforward procedure approach reflecting the API.
