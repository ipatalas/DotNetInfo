.NET Assembly Info plugin v1.0 for Total Commander

About
=====

Provides access to information about .NET assemblies like:
- assembly version
- public key token
- runtime version which the assembly was built for
- architecture (x86, x64 or AnyCPU)

One can use it to find assemblies based on one of these fields and display them in columns for quick access.

Externals
=========

This plugin uses external code by Wyatt (http://wyday.com/blog/2010/how-to-detect-net-assemblies-x86-x64-anycpu/)
License gets included in the build.

It also uses a great nuget package by Robert Giesecke to make unmanaged exports dead simple (https://sites.google.com/site/robertgiesecke/Home/uploads/unmanagedexports)
